# Content

Hi there. This brief guide is for anyone who writes content for our website or facebook page.

## The crux of it

There are four tenets at the heart of everything we write:

* Be honest
* Be clear and use simple language
* Write about the people
* Write as if it were a conversation

### Be honest

>I think most honesty-erosion tends to happen on a smaller scale, where the line between truth and fiction can be pretty blurry. There's a general impulse toward bending that line intentionally, one often motivated by our desire to bring attention to something we believe deserves it. Whether it's a product, a service, or even a cause, we might be willing to "sex up the story" if doing so means bringing greater awareness to it.

> Our best chance for establishing trust with our users is to be honest. After all, trust inspires confidence. Perhaps we should stop fixating on what makes us different and, instead, acknowledge the real aspects of who we are, what we do, and why people choose us.

Write no half-truths nor exaggerations. Content, be it written or a photograph, must be honest and accurate.

### Be clear and use simple language

> Still, we have become a society fearful of revealing who we are. The institutions that seek our support by sending us their brochures sound remarkably alike, though surely all of them - hospitals, schools, libraries, museums, zoos - were founded and are still sustained by men and women with different dreams and visions. Where are these people? It's hard to glimpse them among all the impersonal passive sentences that say "initiatives were undertaken" and "priorities have been identified."
>
But the secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what - these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence.

Use simple language to reveal our personalities and avoid navel-gazing:

> We source the majority of our produce and food locally

Cool.

> In line with our sustainable living objectives, we source...

Not so cool.

### Write about the people

Community members, guests, volunteers, and the staff are rancho i.e. the rancho is people and people are the rancho. For example, when writing a caption for a photograph:

> Nate and Ryan learning the ways of home-made tortillas with DoÃ±a Chapita.

Cool. It's about the people.

> Tortillas making.

Not so cool. It isn't about the people.

### Write as if it were a conversation

Forget about the technology barrier and write as if you are sitting next to the person.

Write in the first person and address the second person (I, we, our and you), and not in the third person (e.g. "Rancho Esperanza offers..."").

* Use we, our, you and your on the website.
* Use I, we, my, our, you and your on facebook e.g. "Hi, I'm Alice, a new volunteer here and this is my story"

## So, who exactly are we writing for?

Good question! For starters, it's not for us.

Write for three (not mutually exclusive) groups:

1. Volunteers looking to give their time to community projects.
2. Conscientious backpacker and surfers looking for a low-impact holiday destination.
3. Donors looking to provide financial assistance to community projects.

These three have slightly different needs and we know that most potential guests are more interested in practical information (prices, directions etc.), whereas most potential volunteers and donors are trying to get a more in-depth feel for the place.

Different needs, same ethos.

## Division of content

Maintaining content is hard work. Doubly so when when you're trying to be honest and it's hot outside. So, we try to minimise the amount of work by:

* not duplicating content by:
  * putting things either on the website or on facebook, but never on both.
  * linking from one to the other e.g. if you're writing about a new volunteer on facebook link back to the 'volunteer opportunities' page on the website.
* putting chronological content that changes often on facebook and less volatile content on the website.
* not writing unneeded cruft in the first place.

> We need a stronger focus on finely tuned minimalistic content. The classic concept of "If I had more time I'd write you a shorter letter" keeps hitting me in the back of the head so I don't forget it. If it's a page, section, or paragraph that doesn't benefit any user then trash it.

### The website

We split the website into two parts:

The story (mainly for the potential volunteers). Write to guide the reader through our story so that they will know whether this is the right place for them. The essence of our story is the people:

> Rancho Esperanza is Nate's dream, but its realization has been achieved through the work of many talented, inspirational and just plain hardworking people. It's the characters you meet here that make the experience. Without the ideas, input, and inspiration of community members, guests, and volunteers, Rancho Esperanza would not exist.

The practical information (extracted out for easy access by the potential guests). Write, without clutter, what people want to know: prices of things, what's on offer, how to contact us and directions to reach us.

### Facebook

We use facebook to keep in contact with our friends and to make new ones. We answer their questions and we let them know our latest news. It's conversational and it's about the people again.

Writing for Facebook is more casual and frequent than for the website, so keep the tenets and the maintenance points from above in mind.
