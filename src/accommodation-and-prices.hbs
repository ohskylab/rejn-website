<h1>Accommodation &amp; Prices</h1>

<p>We aim to minimize our and your impact on the environment. We are reducing our footprint by composting toilet and kitchen waste, being mindful of our water usage, recycling the water we do use via our grey-water system, and maximizing the use of local and natural materials in our buildings.</p>

<p>The open sided, palm roofed Main Rancho is the center of Esperanza life. Spacious and airy, it has a large hammock lounge, communal dining area and plenty of space for doing your own thing. If you can tear yourself away from the beach we have a library with a great selection of hundreds of books, in both Spanish and English, as well as board games, puzzles, a guitar, and a drum.</p>

<h2>Sleeping</h2>

<h2>Eating</h2>

<p>We source the majority of our produce and food locally: our fresh fish comes from the local fishermen, milk and cheese comes from our neighbor&rsquo;s farm, in-season fruits are purchased from local families, and our vegetables come from Chinandega&rsquo;s open-air municipal market.</p>

</figure>

<p>We serve three meals a day for our guests and volunteers, specializing in vegetarian, Asian, and Nicaraguan cuisine.</p>

<p>We begin serving breakfast at 7:30am and it is served ALL DAY! Choices include a large fruit plate, bagels, waffles, oatmeal, yogurt and granola, and eggs. Bottomless mugs of tea and great ecological coffee are served for $.50 until 10:30am.</p>

<p>Lunches and dinners are served family style at our large dining table with a vegetarian option always available. Dinner is the main meal of the day here and we keep it healthy and hearty with lots of vegetables and homemade sauces.</p>

<p>We offer a snack menu and local venders pass through selling fresh mangos, coconut bread, pasteles (little pastries), and, if we&rsquo;re lucky, the occasional ice cream.</p>
