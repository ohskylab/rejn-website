<h1>Community Projects</h1>

<p>Jiquilillo faces many challenges: unemployment and dependence on seasonal work, volatile and persistently low incomes, and a struggling education system. Environmental challenges abound as well, ranging from unsustainable resource use to the lack of a waste management system. We help out in any way we can.</p>

<p>We work with the community of Jiquilillo and surrounding areas to create and support social and environmental programs, while providing an eco-hostel destination for guests and volunteers alike.</p>

<p>The work we do is primarily funded from hostel earnings. Even if you don&rsquo;t volunteer yourself, just by staying at the Rancho for a few days you are supporting your host community. You can also lend additional support to Jiquilillo by <a href="#donatations" title="Find out how to donate">donating</a> to our community projects. If you&rsquo;re interested in dedicating your time and talents to any of our exciting programs, we offer a number of <a href="volunteer-opportunities.html" title="Learn how to become a volunteer with us">volunteer opportunities</a>. We&rsquo;d love to have you!</p>

<p>Our longest-running program is Kids Club, where local kids are welcome every weekday afternoon to learn and play under the guidance of our dedicated volunteers. A number of years ago, through hostel earnings and guest donations, we were able to build a community center that houses Kids Club. We provide a fun and safe setting where the kids can be just kids.</p>

<p>In Kids Club, they enjoy a large collection of age-appropriate books, a lending library, arts and crafts projects, indoor and outdoor games, and receive homework help if they need it. We&rsquo;ve been nurturing the program for over nine years and we are currently working with our second generation of awesome kids!</p>

<p>For the past few years, Jiquilillo has seen an increase in surf tourism. Through our Surf Club, we have made this popular sport accessible to more of Jiquilillo&rsquo;s youth, providing an important positive outlet for many of them. The Club has been a success for a couple of years and the participants have advanced in technical surf skills, are currently running the club on their own, and have learned to professionally repair and maintain boards. They are now able to provide surf lessons to their peers and guests.</p>

<p>All Surf Club participants meet every Saturday to volunteer in a social service for the community. This takes various forms and includes cleaning the beach and road within the community, and maintaining the grounds of our local primary school.</p>

<h2 id="english-classes">English Classes</h2>

<p>English skills are highly valuable in Jiquilillo as tourism is rapidly expanding in Nicaragua. Over the years we&rsquo;ve been able to offer free English classes to both adults and children through the work of committed volunteers.</p>

<h2>School Assistance and Sponsorships</h2>

<p>The Nicaraguan education system lacks adequate funding to maintain even its public schools. We work with the school director, teachers, and local community to determine the most pressing needs of the schools, from teachers&rsquo; supplies and resources to infrastructure, to allow the children access to a basic education.</p>

<p>Although pubic school is free in Nicaragua, the costs of bus fare, uniforms, and school supplies can be prohibitive and keep many children from attending. Through consultation with the local school teachers, we have ensured that a number of kids, including the children of our employees, have been able to continue going to school through our sponsorship program.</p>

<h2 id="economic-development">Economic Development</h2>

<p>Given the economic challenges people face in Jiquilillo, economic development is central to our efforts. We&rsquo;ve been able to employ an expanding base of local staff who are paid a fair wage and provided benefits. We also provide assistance in local tourism development, including training and support to locals and local groups interested in starting tourism-oriented enterprises.</p>

<h2>Clinic Transport</h2>

<p>Jiquilillo and the surrounding area lack an ambulance service and have limited public transportation, with the last bus leaving at 3:30 in the afternoon. If there is any medical emergency, we provide free transport to the nearest medical facility located 45 minutes from Jiquilillo. Our services have assisted in bringing four new lives into the community!</p>

      <p>You can donate to our ongoing projects, new projects, and requests from the community, via <a href="http://fnd.us/c/dOyBe">Fundrazr</a> (our secure fund-raising site). Many guests and volunteers have also supported our projects by packing items to bring with them on their trips to Nicaragua. The children and teachers of Jiquilillo would benefit from the supplies outlined on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/rancho-esperanza/needed-materials-in-kind-donations/599283556763685">continuously-updated list on Facebook</a>.</p>
